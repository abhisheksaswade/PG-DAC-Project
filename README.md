# Online E-Spare Store
This is a modern web-based platform designed to buy spare part by small retailers directly from wholesaler distributor. In earlier days shopkeeper get the products from the chain of 2 to 3 dealers due to which retailers get very less margin on that product. This platform establishes direct relationship between official distributor and retailer. 
Additionally, all the business operations like placing orders, payment on customer side, managing products,
stock on distributor side, managing delivery updates on delivery-person side now can be done very easily in few clicks. Administrator now can easily monitor entire chain of business operations online
and if necessary, improve on it.
